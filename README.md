# Conarx Containers

All our Docker images are part of our Conarx Containers product line. Images are generally based on Alpine Linux and track the
Alpine Linux major and minor version in the format of `vXX.YY`.

Images built from source track both the Alpine Linux major and minor versions in addition to the main software component being
built in the format of `vXX.YY-AA.BB`, where `AA.BB` is the main software component version.

Our images are built using our Flexible Docker Containers framework which includes the below features...

- Flexible container initialization and startup
- Integrated unit testing
- Advanced multi-service health checks
- Native IPv6 support for all containers
- Debugging options
